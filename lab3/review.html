            <p> Hello whoever is there looking at my page. My name is Frederica Torres but I go by freddie.
                I have many hobbies and passions, but my main things are art and music, I am an art major after all.
                I am also in a band with three dudes who are cool, our name is Carabeza.
                I grew up in Mexico City with my mom, it was pretty sick, then moved to LA with my dad.
                Thats my story.
            </p>
